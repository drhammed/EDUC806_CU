## Chapter 1- Introduction to SPSS for Quantitative Research

Welcome to the lab section of EDUC 806.

### Learning Objectives

-   Become Familiar with the SPSS environment

-   Learn how to prepare and manage data in SPSS

-   Learn how to perform descriptive statistics and inferential statistics using SPSS.

### Software for Statistical Analysis

There are several software available for statistical analysis. For this course, we will be using SPSS throughout the semester. However, anyone interested in using R (or Python) should feel free to do so (and I'm happy to chat about that). If you're generally interested in using R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website [R Workshop for Statistical Analysis](https://drhammed.github.io/bookdown_workshop/ "R Workshop for Statistical Analysis").
