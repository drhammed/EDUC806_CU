Welcome to EDUC 806. This website will be used for all the tutorials of this course. For this course, we will be using SPSS throughout the semester. However, anyone interested in using R (or Python) should feel free to do so (and I'm happy to chat about that). If you're generally interested in using R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website [R Workshop for Statistical Analysis](https://drhammed.github.io/bookdown_workshop/ "R Workshop for Statistical Analysis").

In fact, this website was built entirely using R!
