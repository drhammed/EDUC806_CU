<p>Welcome to the lab section of EDUC 806. This section will focus (primarily) on demonstrating how to use “SPSS” for statistical analysis. This website will be updated as the course progresses. I’m passionate about open science and reproducibility- so my goal is to make this website readily available for anyone and methods covered reproducible as much as possible. As such, all the links to download any open data will be embedded in the website (so you can just click it and download as needed).</p>
<section id="learning-objectives-for-this-chapter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-objectives-for-this-chapter">Learning Objectives for this Chapter</h4>
<p>For this lab, we will get familiar with the SPSS software layout, and do basic descriptive statistics of some sample data to make sense of it. Specifically, we will be doing the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Opening SPSS and the SPSS layout- become familiar with the SPSS environment</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to prepare and manage data in SPSS- reviewing data view and the Variable View tab</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to perform descriptive statistics using SPSS- opening a sample data and producing different graphs</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="software-for-statistical-analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="software-for-statistical-analysis">Software for Statistical Analysis</h4>
<p>There are several software available for statistical analysis. For this course, we will be using SPSS throughout the semester. However, anyone interested in using R (or Python) should feel free to do so (and I’m happy to chat about that). If you’re generally interested in using R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website <a href="https://drhammed.github.io/bookdown_workshop/" title="R Workshop for Statistical Analysis">R Workshop for Statistical Analysis</a>.</p>

<section id="data-importentry-and-preparation-in-spss" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-importentry-and-preparation-in-spss"><strong>Data Import/Entry and Preparation in SPSS</strong></h4>
<p>There are a couple different ways to load in data in SPSS.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Directly enter the data in the <em>“data”</em> view of SPSS. Variable name in columns and observations in rows and values in between. However, this can be time consuming especially when working with large dataset or if you already have them in different file formats (e.g.&nbsp;csv).</li>
<li>Click on the <em>“File”</em> menu of SPSS, scroll down to <em>“import’</em> and select the file format you’d like to choose.</li>
<li>If you have the data saved somewhere, or want to open data in “SPSS .sav format”, you can click on <em>“File”</em>, select the <em>“Open”</em>, and then <em>“Data.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve loaded the data, the next thing is to check the information of variables. This can be achieved by clicking on the <em>“variable view”</em> beside the “data view” (in the main SPSS window). Technically, the data view shows the full data you just loaded and the variable view represents the additional (important) information of the loaded data. On this variable view screen, you can give the name to the variable and define properties. For example, you can decide to code the “missing data” as “999” here, set the “measure” as (nominal, ordinal, or scale), code categorical data as 0 and 1 (as needed), etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-management" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-management">Data Management</h4>
<p>In SPSS, you can process and make modifications to your raw data, including changing string to numeric data, computing a new variable, and merging multiple categories among others.</p>
<p>There are two important functions that can be used for data management in SPSS.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Transform &amp; Recode function</strong> - this can be used to recode data into different variables.</p>
<p><img src="images/recode_new_var-01.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compute Function</strong>- to compute a new summary variable. To do this, click on “transform”, then “compute variable’.</p>
<p><img src="images/compute_variable.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong></p>
<p>Descriptive statistics provide a description, summary and show meaningful patterns in data using measure of central tendency and measure of dispersion (spread). The measure of central tendency include mean, median, mode and measure of dispersion include, standard deviation, variance, range, minimum and maximum statistic (which describe how the data is dispersed/spread).</p>
<p>Note- we may not use range and min/max at the same time, same way we may not use Variance at the same time we use SD. This is because one is derivative of other. Put simply,</p>
<p><code>Range = max - min</code></p>
<p>Standard Deviation = <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{variance}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Importance of Descriptive Statistics,</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data exploration</li>
<li>Give general sample description</li>
<li>See if data are loaded correctly</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of descriptive stat, it is equally important to examine the distribution of data - that is whether the data is normally (or not) distributed. This can be checked by plotting the data and or through a calculation of skewness and kurtosis.</p>
<p>In SPSS, there are two ways to perform descriptive stat- frequencies and descriptive (which usually produces the same result).</p>
<p><strong>Let’s see how it’s done in SPSS.</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this lab, we shall be using this example data which can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mq7Lzfxssa0yHRjYb033BsS_8AqQNWZz?usp=sharing">here</a>. This dataset contains demographic information of random participants and the quality of life. No identity is revealed and the data can be freely used.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re interested in calculating the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) as well as dispersion/spread (standard deviation, variance, and range). First, download the dataset in the link above (“Example_data_Lab1.sav or xlsx). Load the downloaded data into the SPSS spreadsheet (you’d see something like below):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Descrip_Stat.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><em>Now, let’s calculate descriptive statistics,</em></p>
<p>From the default view, go to the top menu and selecta <em>Analyze</em>, then <em>Descriptive Statistics</em> and then <em>Frequencies</em>:</p>
<p>A new window will pop up and ask you to specify for which variables you’d like to calculate descriptive statistics. Use the arrow to move the Age variable from the left-hand to the right-hand field (as seen here).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Freq_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, click the <em>Statistics</em> button. This will open a new window containing a list of statistics. Select mean. median. mode, range and standard deviation (of course, you can select as many as you want to be calculated). Also, select skewness and kurtosis (to check normality assumption).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Freq_2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Click <em>Continue</em>, and then <em>OK</em>. SPSS will produce the output table(s) containing the descriptive statistics we have chosen. If you calculate the frequency table, it will also include a frequency table–a list of all the possible values in the data set and their corresponding frequencies.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Output_Freq-01.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Task one</strong></p>
<p><em>Remember I said there are two ways to perform descriptive statistics in SPSS. I have shown the “frequencies” route. Now, perform descriptive statistics using the “descriptives” route. (hint- follow the same description above but instead of choosing the frequencies, select descriptives and do the same thing again).</em></p>
</section>
<section id="descriptive-statistics-and-histograms" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="descriptive-statistics-and-histograms">Descriptive Statistics and Histograms</h4>
<p>Here, we will continue with our measure of central tendency and dispersion as in the example above, but with the addition of a histogram to viisualize the distribution of our data (in relation to the chosen descriptive statistics).</p>
<p>Imagine we wanted to know about quality of life across our respondents in the questionnaire, we can achieve this by calculating descriptive statistics, as well as plotting a histogram to examine the distribution of the data. Good thing is that SPSS has neat ways to plot data while calculating different measure of central tendency or dispersion. For instance, we can expand the example above by add the “<em>histogram</em>” plot to the output without using the graphs menu in SPSS (much easier)! Using the same dataset as above, we can calculate the descriptive statistics of quality of life.</p>
<p>Like we did the other time, navigate to Analyze, then Descriptive Statistics, and then Frequencies. Select and drag the “<strong><em>quality of life</em></strong>”, and then move it into the field (“variable”) on the right using the arrow.</p>
<p>Like in the last example, click the Statistics button and choose your measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion/spread (range, standard deviation, variance).</p>
<p>Click continue, then we are back to the other window. Now before you proceed, ask SPSS to insert a histogram by clicking on the Charts button, then “histogram” (and check off Show normal curve on histogram):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Charts_hist.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Finally, you can click continue, and then OK.</p>
<p>With this, SPSS will generate a table of the chosen descriptive statistics, and a histogram showing the distribution of quality of life with a superimposed normal distribution (for comparison):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Result_hist1-01.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From this result, we can easily see pattern of the data. The data contains minimum value of 3 and maximum of 20. The mean quality of life (QOL) is 11.45. Thus, we can say the central tendency of this distribution seems to be a good representation as the mean value is not so far from minimum and maximum value. It is however necessary to be sure the data doesn’t contain outliers as mean statistic is sensitive to outliers. In other words, to have good representation (average) in frequency distribution, your data must be controlled from outliers. Median (middle term in a data arranged in order of magnitude) is another commonly used statistic that is less affected by outliers and skewed data. From the result above, the median QOL is 11.50. This value is close to the mean which denote a possiblity of symmetrical distribution. It is also worth noting that median is mostly applicable to ordinal data set and skewed scale variable and may not be a reliable measure of central position if otherwise. Mode is the most frequent score in a data set and often the highest bar in histogram. From the result above, the quality of life with highest frequency is 15. However, mode may not also be a reliable measure of central position of this data as its applicable to categorical or nominal data set. Looking at the table, we can see that the values of mean, median and mode are very close and implies that the distribution is (almost) symmetrical.</p>
<p>Standard deviation (SD) measures the spread of the data. The larger the value of SD, the more spread out the observations are. The SD of QOL is 4.394- which implies the QOL measurements are spread out relatively far from their mean position. Skewness represent how a variable is normally distributed around the mean position. Skeweness of 0 = normal (symmetrical) distribution. Value of skewenss close to 0 = near symmetrical. Less than 0 = negative skeweness. greater than 0 = positive skeweness. Looking at the table, the skewenss of QOL = 0.030 (skewness close to 0- near symmetrical). We can also check the histogram to confirm this. Note that, If the plot was perfectly symmetrical, the value of mean, median and mode should be exactly same thing.</p>
<p>Lastly, Kurtosis measures the heaviness of the tail of distribution. A normal distribution = 0 kurtosis. Kurtosis is positive if the tails are heavier than for a normal distribution and negative if lighter. From the result above, kurtosis = -0.845 for QOL (which indicates a nearly normally distribution since they’re close to 0). However, since Kurtosis is negative here, it means that there are less data distribution at the tails- which means the data are centered around the mean position.</p>

<section id="mean-confidence" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mean-confidence">Mean Confidence</h4>
<p>Last week, we examined (among other things) the mean, median, mode and standard deviation. Also, we mentioned how the mean was representative of the data we looked at. Recall, the mean is about central tendency (where you have most of the data under the curve) and the standard deviation is about the variance.</p>
<p>Now (with respect to last week example), imagine I only told you that the sample mean = 11.44 (and no other information about the estimates/data). The next question here should be how “confident” we are that most of the number will be close to “11.44”. Specifically, one would be curious about the sample variation and how different they are from the sample mean (11.44). This implies that the mean alone doesn’t tell the full story about how well it represent the data. It could be either representative of the sample (assuming standard deviation is small) or non-representative (if standard deviation is large). So, in order to be “confident” about how well mean represent the data, one need to know the standard deviation.</p>
<p><em>How can we relate the mean and the standard deviation together, to give us a new number that tells us about the mean confidence?</em></p>
<p>Thus, one could say the</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
confidence = \dfrac {mean} {standard \hspace1ex deviation}
\]</span></p>
<p>The lower the standard deviation, the more confident we would be in the mean representation (because the value of confidence will be big). This confidence is very useful in the sense that it tells us about the ratio between what we think about our sample (the mean), and the variability in our sample (the standard deviation). In fact, this is the basic formula for the <strong>t-test</strong>!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t =  \dfrac {measure \hspace1ex of \hspace1ex effect} {measure \hspace1ex of \hspace1ex error}
\]</span></p>
</section>
<section id="t-test" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="t-test">T-test</h4>
<p>Generally, t-test is used to compare the differences in mean scores of (continuous) normally distributed data and used in hypothesis testing. Basically, you’d have to set a null (<span class="math inline">\(H_o\)</span>) hypothesis and alternate (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>)) hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_o\)</span> = no effective difference between the observed sample mean &amp; the (hypothesized) population mean— simply put, <em>difference in group means is zero</em> and any measured difference is due only to “chance”.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> = difference in group means is different from zero (i.e.&nbsp;there are differences between the observed sample mean and the population mean).</p>
<p>A student <em>t</em>-test can be either one or two-sided (also termed two-tailed). A one-sided test shows whether the observed mean is smaller or larger than the population mean and two-tailed t-test imply that the means are not equivalent. Also, the “t” test statistic is then calculated. Simply put, you reject the null hypothesis of your t-test if the observed <em>t</em>-statistic is more extreme than the <strong>critical value</strong> determined by the appropriate reference distribution. Where the appropriate reference distribution for the <em>t</em>-statistic is the <em>t</em> distribution. The critical value depends on the significance level of the test (the probability of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis).</p>
<p><strong>One-sample t-test</strong></p>
<p>This is used to estimate the probability that your sample came from a specific population. Specifically, one sample t-test can be used to determine whether your sample mean, could have come from a paricular population having a specific mean. Technically, it uses the population known parameter, like the mean of the population and the standard deviation of the population. However, most times you don’t know those parameters of the population! So, you have to estimate them from your sample.</p>
<p>Recall from the formula of t-test we said earlier,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t = \frac{{\text{{measure of effect}}}}{{{\text{{measure of error}}}}}\]</span></p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t =  \dfrac {mean \hspace1ex difference} {standard \hspace1ex error \hspace1ex of \hspace1ex mean}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math display">\[
Mean \hspace1ex difference =  sample \hspace1ex mean -  population \hspace1ex mean
\]</span></p>
<p>Some points/assumptions here.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Continuous data.</p></li>
<li><p>data should be a random sample and come from a</p></li>
<li><p>normal population (normal distribution)</p></li>
<li><p>Independent (values are not related to one another).</p></li>
<li><p>No outliers.</p></li>
<li><p>homoscedastic- homogeneity of variance</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Meaning of this “t”</strong></p>
<p>Put simply, <em>t</em> only tells us about the level of confidence in our data and nothing more. It is a property of the data and calculated by dividing the mean difference with the standard error of the sample.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Standard Error of Mean} = \frac{{\text{{Standard Deviation}}}}{{\sqrt{{\text{{N}}}}}} \]</span></p>
<p>Take for example, your sample mean is 10 and you want to know if it came from a population also with mean of 10. Apparently, In this case, your <em>t</em> would be zero (10-10). This means there’s no difference between your sample mean and population mean. Now, imagine you resample and your mean is now 12 (because the sample mean may not necessarily be the same every time you sample), the value of <em>t</em> would clearly be 2 (12-10 = 2). However,it is also worth noting that the direction of the sign will depend on the estimated standard error. Which means, If the standard error of the sample is positive, then t could be positive (and negative if otherwise). So, if the standard error is smaller, the t gets bigger and thus, we could be more confident in the mean difference.</p>
<p>Now, let’s practice this using data</p>

<section id="one-sample-t-test-in-spss" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-sample-t-test-in-spss">One-Sample t-test in SPSS</h4>
<p>The link to download the data for this example can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AlSe-sNL1ZArOd79SuSiyvCtgs8xPrU8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the mean height of U.S. adults of age &gt;= 20 is about 66.5 inches (63.8 for females and 69.3 for males)- <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr122-508.pdf">reported by CDC</a>. In this example data, we have a sample of over 400 college students from a college. We are interested in testing if the mean height of students at this particular college is significantly different than 66.5 inches (using a one-sample <em>t</em> test).</p>
<p>To start this, we need to state the null and alternative hypotheses:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_o\)</span> = the mean height of students in this college = 66.5</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> = the mean height of students in this college is not equal to 66.5</p>
<p>But before we move on, it maybe good to do a quick <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong></p>
<p>For this example, we will use the <em>Height</em> variable (a continuous variable representing each respondent’s height in inches). The heights shows a range of values from 55.00 to 84.41 (click on <strong>Analyze</strong> &gt; <strong>Descriptive</strong> <strong>Statistics</strong> &gt; <strong>Descriptives</strong>- check the min and max value to see that).</p>
<p>Also, let’s create a histogram of the data so we can get an idea of the distribution, and to see if our hypothesized mean (test value) is near our sample mean. To do this, you can click <strong>Graphs &gt; Histogram</strong>. Move variable Height to the Variable dialog box, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Hist_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From the plot, we can see that height is relatively symmetrically distributed about the mean (although there is a slightly long tail towards the right). The reference lines indicate that sample mean is slightly greater than the hypothesized mean (but not so much). This is a clue that the result of t-test may be significant, but let’s run it and see.</p>
<p>To do this in SPSS, you can click on&nbsp;<em><strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; One-Sample T Test</strong>.</em> Move the variable <em>Height</em> to the <strong>Test Variable(s)</strong> area.</p>

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/On-sample_ttest_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>

</div>
<p>Ideally, the One-Sample T Test window should open and you can specify the variables to be used in the analysis. Like last week example (if you look at the left), all of the variables in your dataset will appear in the list on the left side. You can the drag variables of interest to the <strong>Test Variable(s)</strong> area by selecting them in the list and click the move arrow button. In the <strong>Test Value</strong> field, enter 66.5.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/one sample t-test.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Test Variable(s):</strong> The variable you want to compare its mean to the test value (hypothesized population mean). You can also run multiple One Sample <em>t</em> Tests simultaneously if you select more than one test variable. Each variable will be compared to the same Test Value.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Test Value:</strong> The (hypothesized) population mean against which you will compare your test variable(s).</p>
<p><strong>Estimate effect sizes:</strong> This is optional but If checked, it will print effect size statistics -- specifically, the Cohen’s <em>d</em> -- for the test(s). (Note: If you do not see this option in your own SPSS, it might be that you’re using the old version of SPSS).</p>
<p>Lastly, if you click on <strong><em>Options,</em></strong>it will open a window where you can specify the <strong>Confidence Interval Percentage</strong> and how the test should treat <strong>Missing Values</strong> (i.e., <strong>Exclude cases analysis by analysis</strong> or <strong>Exclude cases listwise</strong>). Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you’re done, you can click <strong>OK</strong> to run the One Sample <em>t</em> Test.</p>
<p>See below for the output:</p>

</div>
<p>Two sections appear in the one-sample t-test output: <strong>One-Sample Statistics</strong> and <strong>One-Sample Test</strong>. The first section, <strong>One-Sample Statistics</strong>, provides general information about the “Height”- including the valid (nonmissing) sample size (<em>n- 408</em>), mean (68.0 3inches), standard deviation, and standard error.</p>
<p><em>The second section, <strong>One-Sample Test</strong>, displays the results most relevant to the One Sample t Test.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Test Value</strong>: The same number we entered as the test value above.</li>
<li><strong>t Statistic</strong>: The “t” test statistic of the one-sample <em>t</em> test. From the result above, we can see that <em>t</em> = 5.810. Recall, like we described above, <em>t</em> is calculated by dividing the mean difference by the standard error of the sample.</li>
<li><strong>Mean Difference</strong>: This represent the difference between the “observed” sample mean and the “expected” mean (test value). The sign of the mean difference corresponds to the sign of the <em>t</em> value. The positive <em>t</em> value (in this case) denotes that the mean height of the sample is &gt; than the test (hypothesized) value (66.5).</li>
<li><strong>df</strong>: The degrees of freedom. For a one-sample <em>t</em> test, df = <em>n</em> - 1; so here, df = 408 - 1 = 407.</li>
<li><strong>Significance</strong> (One-Sided p and Two-Sided p): The p-values of the possible one-sided alternative hypotheses (mean height &gt; 66.5) and two-sided alternative hypothesis (mean height ≠ 66.5), respectively. We were only interested in the two-sided alternative hypothesis, based on our hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence Interval for the Difference</strong>: The confidence interval for the difference between the our chosen test value and the sample mean.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Recall from our hypothesis above, the test value was 66.5 inches (which represent the average adult height in the U.S). However, from our result, since p &lt; 0.001 (significant across all conventional levels of significance), we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the mean height of students in that particular college is 66.5. Thus, we can conclude that the mean height of students in that college is significantly different than 66.5 inches.</p>
<p>In other words, we can say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a significant difference in the mean height of the students in that college and the overall adult population in the U.S. (<em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>and</p></li>
<li><p>The average students height of this college is about 1.53 inches taller than the average U.S. adult population (95% CI [1.013, 2.050]).</p></li>

<section id="two-sample-t-test-independent-sample" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-sample-t-test-independent-sample">Two Sample t-Test (Independent Sample)</h4>
<p>In independent sample (two sample t-Test), there is a single factor (explanatory) variable with two levels which split the subjects into two groups. Often, one level is considered the <strong>control</strong>, while the other is the <strong>treatment</strong>. Then, the subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Following the assignment to a group, each subject has some quantity measured- tagged the response (dependent/outcome) variable.</p>
<p>Recall that this model makes assumption- normality, homogeneity of variance and independence. It is also important to note that, if the assumption is not met, an equivalent non-parametric test would be appropiate (e.g.- Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test).</p>
<p>The question here is: are there differences between the two groups? Specifically, the question we want to ask is: are the means of the two groups different or the same?</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0 = \mu_1 = \mu_2 \hspace 2ex or \hspace3ex H_a = \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
\]</span></p>
<p>As such, for this stated model (and assuming the null hypothesis is true), then the <em>t</em> test statistic should follow a <em>t</em> distribution with degrees of freedom <span class="math display">\[ n_1 \hspace1ex + n_2 \hspace1ex -2\]</span></p>
<p>Example 2-</p>
<p>In our sample dataset, students reported their normal time to run a mile, and whether (or not) they were an athlete. Now, we would like to know if the average time to run a mile is different for athletes versus non-athletes. This involves testing whether the sample means for mile time among athletes and non-athletes are statistically different (and by extension, inferring whether the means for mile times in the population are significantly different between these two groups).</p>
<p>For this problem, we can use a two-sample (Independent Samples) <em>t</em> Test to compare the mean mile time for athletes and non-athletes.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_o : \text {the mean of non-athlete - mean of athlete} = 0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_a  : \text {the mean of non-athlete - mean of athlete} \neq 0\]</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Do it in SPSS.</em></strong></p>
<p>For this, we will use two variables: Athlete and MileMinDur. The variable Athlete has values of either “0” (non-athlete) or “1” (athlete). It will function as the independent variable in this T test. The variable MileMinDur is a numeric duration variable (h:mm:ss), and it will function as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>To do it in SPSS, click&nbsp;<strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; Independent-Samples T Test</strong>.</p>
<p>The Independent-Samples (two sample) t-Test window opens where you can specify the variables to be used in the analysis. All of the variables will appear here on the left side. Like the othe time, you can move variables to the right by selecting them and clicking the blue arrow buttons. You can move a variable(s) to either of two areas: <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> or <strong>Test Variable(s)</strong>.</p>
<p>The:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test Variable(s)=</strong> response/dependent variable(s). This is the continuous variable whose means we want to compare between the two groups. You can also run multiple <em>t</em> tests simultaneously by selecting more than one test variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grouping Variable = explanatory/</strong> independent variable. The categories (or groups) of the independent variable will define which samples will be compared in the <em>t</em> test. This must have at least two categories (groups). Although this may have more than two categories, a <em>t</em> test can only compare two groups, so you will need to specify which two groups to compare (if it’s more than two, then you look at multi-factorial ANOVA, for example). You can also use a continuous variable by specifying a cut point to create two groups (i.e., values at or above the cut point and values below the cut point).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Define Groups</strong>: Click <strong>Define Groups</strong> to define the category indicators (groups) to use in the <em>t</em> test. If the button is not active, make sure that you have already moved your independent variable to the right in the <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> field. You must define the categories of your grouping variable before you can run the Independent Samples <em>t</em> Test procedure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Options:</strong> The Options section is where you can set your confidence level for the confidence interval for the mean difference, and specify how SPSS should handle missing values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re done, click <strong>OK</strong> to run the Independent Samples <em>t</em> Test, or click <strong>Paste</strong> to have the syntax corresponding to your specified settings written to an open syntax window. (If you do not have a syntax window open, a new window will pop up).</p>

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/two-sample_output_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Again, two sections appear in the output:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Group Statistics</strong> which provide basic information about our comparisons- such as the sample size, mean, sd and standard error for mile times by group. From the result, we can see that there are 166 athletes and 226 non-athletes. The mean mile time for athletes is 6 minutes 51 seconds, and the mean mile time for non-athletes is 9 minutes 6 seconds.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Independent Samples Test</strong> displays the results most relevant to the two-Samples <em>t</em> Test. There are two parts that provide different pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances - <em>F</em> is the test statistic of Levene’s test and <em>Sig.</em> is the p-value corresponding to this test statistic. From the result, we can see the p-value is so low. So, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So, we can conclude that the variance in mile time of athletes is significantly different than that of non-athletes variance. This imply that, we should observe the <strong>the “Equal variances not assumed” row for the <em>t</em> test (and corresponding confidence interval) results.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>t-test for Equality of Means- provides the results for the actual Independent Samples <em>t</em> Test.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Given that <em>p</em> &lt; .001 is less than significance level of <em>α</em> = 0.05 (our preferred level), we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the that the mean mile time for athletes and non-athletes is significantly different.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There was a significant difference in mean mile time between non-athletes and athletes <span class="math inline">\((t_{315.846} = = 15.047, p &lt; .001)\)</span> .</p></li>
<li><p>The average mile time for athletes was 2 minutes and 14 seconds lower than the average mile time for non-athletes.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="model-terminology" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-terminology"><strong>Model terminology</strong></h4>
<p>Often, we hear different (statistical) terms including linear regression, linear models and ANOVA and sometimes wonder the differences in all of them are. Statistically speaking, they're all fundamentally the same thing!</p>
<p>Linear model and Linear regression are just synonyms! People often use either terms when quantifying the effect of a “<strong>continuous”</strong> independent variable on a”<strong>continuous”</strong> dependent (response) variable. For example, one might be interested in saying “For every 1 unit change in X, what is the corresponding change in Y”? What is the change in academic performance for each additional hour of studying per day among high school students? For example, imagine we have data on the number of hours that high school students spend studying each day and their academic performance (e.g.&nbsp;scores), we can use this data to determine the relationship between these two variables. By analyzing the data, we could calculate the change in academic performance for each extra hour of studying per day among the participants.</p>
<p>To do this, we could easily use a linear model to explore the relationship between them and estimate the “slope” of the line that best describes the relationship between the number of hours spent studying (X) and academic performance (Y). The slope of this line would then indicate the change in academic performance associated with each extra hour of studying per day (our research question)</p>
<p>In a simple mathematical equation, we could represent our model as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>Y = dependent variable (academic performance)</p>
<p>X = independent variable (inumber of hours spent studying)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = \text{intercept (the estimated academic performance when X is 0)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \text{slope (the estimated change in academic performance associated with each extra hour of studying per day)}\)</span></p>
<p>With this linear model, we can then estimate the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and academic performance, and determine whether there is a significant relationship between them. Also, we could use this model to make prediction (for examle, to predict academic performance for different levels of studying time).</p>
<p>However <strong>ANOVA</strong> (Analysis of Variance), is usually used when quantifying the effect of a “<strong>discrete (or categorical)”</strong> independent variable on a”<strong>continuous”</strong> dependent variable. Imagine we have data on job satisfaction scores for employees from three different departments of company A, and we want to estimate how the mean job satisfaction score varies per department. We can use ANOVA (<em>a linear model</em>) to estimate the <strong>mean job satisfaction score</strong> for each department.</p>
<p>We can define our model to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Job Satisfaction} = \mu + \beta_1Department_1 + \beta_2Department_2 + \beta_3Department_3 + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>Job Satisfaction is the Y- dependent variable (<em>what we want to predict</em>)</p>
<p>Department1, 2, and 3 represent indicator variables for each department (value of 0 and 1. 1 if the employee belongs to that department, and 0 otherwise).</p>
<p>μ = intercept- i.e overall mean job satisfaction score or better put, the estimated mean job satisfaction score when all departments are 0 (i.e., the reference category). This intercept captures the baseline level of job satisfaction that is not attributable to any specific department.</p>
<p><strong>β</strong>1, 2, and 3 = the coefficients (i.e.&nbsp;the estimated mean difference in job satisfaction score between each department and the reference department)</p>
<p>ε is the error term (i.e.&nbsp;the unexplained variation in job satisfaction scores).</p>
<p>By fitting this model, we can estimate the mean job satisfaction score for each department, and compare them to see if there are any significant differences. For example, suppose we find that the estimated mean job satisfaction score for Department 1 = 82, for Department 2 is 64, and for Department 3 = 50. This would suggest that there are significant differences in job satisfaction scores across departments, and we can further investigate why this might be the case.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, <em>ANOVA is also a linear regression</em> and even if you run “anova” function on linear model object, you’ll most likely get the same p-value. Here is a <a href="https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/why-anova-and-linear-regression-are-the-same-analysis/">link</a> to an article explaining everything in more details</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-way-anova"><strong>One-Way ANOVA</strong></h4>
<p>ANOVA is a parametric test and simply an extension of two-samples t-test. By Parametric, I mean it make assumptions regarding the shape of the population. Such assumption includes normal distribution in each factor level, commonly refers to as a “bell-shaped” curve, homogeneity (equal variance) and that the observations are independent. Basically, in your research or more broadly, statistics, you often hear or conduct one or two way ANOVA. What this means is about the factor in question (the number of predictors/explanatory/independent variables). In one-way ANOVA,you only have one independent (factor) variable and in a two-way ANOVA, you have two. We shall see examples below.</p>
<p>Like t-test, when conducting ANOVA, we need to set up hypothesis. Basically, you have either <span class="math inline">\(H_0 (null) \hspace1ex or \hspace1ex H_a (\text{alternate hypothesis})\)</span></p>
<p>Usually, your <span class="math inline">\(H_0 = \text{no difference in the mean of your groups. Simply put, your observations comes from populations with the same variance (homoscedastic). }\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H_a = \text{there is a difference (heteroscedastic).}\)</span></p>
<p>To test for this assumption of homoscedasticity, we can use the Levene’s test (see below).</p>
<p>N.B: if your null hypothesis is rejected, you should not proceed with the standard ANOVA test- perhaps consider the equivalent non-parametric test (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis test).</p>
<p>The hypothesis should Ideally be stated explicitly, such as below:</p>

<p>Let’s quickly demonstrate this with data</p>
<p>We shall be using the Circadian data. You can download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0GnAaPwxMgw3lO9G_2mOjyNUEsqwNcd/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s load the data.</p>
<p>For quick context, the data is about jet lag and adjusting to a different time zone. Campbell and Murphy (1998) claimed people adjust to their new time zone once the light reset their internal, circadian clock. Wright and Czeisler 2002 revisited this study and measured the circadian rhythm of melatonin production. They subjected 22 people to random treatments; control, knees only and eyes. Please read more on this paper <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.1071697">online</a> (Wright and Czeisler 2002).</p>
<p>So for our analysis, we want to compare phase shifts in the circadian rhytm of melatonin productions in participants given another light treatments.</p>
<p>Recall we said, ANOVA <em>is</em> a <strong>linear regression</strong> BUT the predictor variables are <em>categorical</em> instead of being <em>continuous</em>. Also, rather than estimating the <em>slope</em> (in the case of regression), <strong>with ANOVA you obtain an estimate (mean) of the response variable for each independent variable category.</strong></p>
<p>Now, let’s do this in SPSS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click&nbsp;<strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; One-Way ANOVA</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the variable Shift to the <strong>Dependent List</strong> box,</p></li>
<li><p>Add the variable treatment to the <strong>Factor</strong> box. Here, the “treatment” variable may not show (because we have it as string). So, we need to recode it to categories. Click on “Transform”, then “Automatic recode”. Recode the “treatment”, save it with a new name and add it to the “Factor box”.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Options</strong>. Check the box for <strong>Homogeneity of Variance</strong>, then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>OK</strong> when finished.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Output for the analysis will display in the <strong><em>Output Viewer</em></strong> window.</p>

<p><strong><em>Homogeneity of Variance</em></strong></p>
<p>From the levene test, we can see that the P value is &gt; 0.05 (0.85), there is no evidence to reject the H0 (they have the same variance). So, we can proceed with ANOVA</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Levene_Test-Homogeneity of Variance.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Normality test</em></strong></p>
<p>From the Shapiro normality test, the P-value = 0.813, which is greater than the chosen P-value (0.05) and therefore, we have strong evidence to conclude that this data comes from a normal population, as such normality assumption is met.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Shapiro_wilk.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Looking at the result of ANOVA table and since p is &lt; our chosen alpha level (0.05), we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there IS a difference somewhere among the treatment groups. Put formally, we conclude that the mean shift time for melatonin production is significantly different for at least one of our treatment groups (<em>F</em><sub>2,&nbsp;19</sub> = 7.289, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). Please note that the ANOVA alone does not specifically tell us which means were different from one another.</p>
<p>So, to determine that and since the ANOVA test is significant, we would need to do <em>multiple comparisons</em> (<em>post-hoc</em>) tests.</p>
<p>You may want to compute the Tukey test to check for pairwise-comparison between the means of groups. To do this, run the ANOVA again, but this time, select the “Post Hoc” button and choose Tukey. Your result window will open (and should be similar to the one below)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Tukey_ANOVA.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this table, we can see that every possible group of 2 treatments (pair-wise) is being compared. With our chosen p-value (0.05), we can easily decide which comparisons are significantly different from one other. For instance, If you look at the 1st row, this row compares “control vs eyes.” Given that the p-value for this row = 0.008 (less than our chosen p-value), we have evidence to say that these two groups ARE significantly different.</p>
<p><em>Which other row can we find a p-value that is less than 0.05 (our chosen p-value)</em>?</p>
<p>Looking at the comparison between “eyes vs knee”, we can see the p-value = 0.012 (also a significant difference).</p>
<p>So, we have evidence to conclude that among the 3 groups, only two differences were found: control is significantly different from eyes, and knee is different from eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Homogenous Subsets</strong></p>
<p>Also, the last table we see here is the homogeneous subsets.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Homogenous_Subsets.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Technically, this table gives the similar information as Tukey table albeit easier to use. In this table you will see the treatments listed on the left, and a number of "subsets"–here, we have 2 subsets (2 columns labeled 1 and 2, respectively). In these columns, the means of the treatments are listed.</p>
<p>To interpret this table is easy! Simply put, If the means of two groups (treatments here) NEVER appear in the same column together, they <strong><em>are</em></strong> significantly different from one another. However, if the means of two groups appear in the same column together, then they are <strong><em>not</em></strong> significantly different from one another.</p>
<p>Looking at the table, it’s easier to see that “knee” and “control” both have their means on the same column (and hence are not significantly different from one another). However, the mean of “eyes” NEVER appear in the same column as “control” and “knee” and we can conclude that their means are significantly different.</p>
<p>Thus, If you go through every possible comparison, you will still find that the only differences are between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>eyes vs.&nbsp;control</p></li>
<li><p>eyes vs.&nbsp;knee</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Same as when we did Tukey up there!</p>
</section>
<section id="revisiting-t-test" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revisiting-t-test">Revisiting T-test</h4>
<p>Instead of the Tukey (unplanned) comparison we just did, we could also conduct T-test to find out which groups are different and where the differences are (refer to last week discussion). This way, we would conduct as many t-tests of pairwise comparisons as possible. That is (and in our case), if you have 3 treatment groups, you can make the following pairwise comparisons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eyes vs.&nbsp;control</li>
<li>eyes vs.&nbsp;knee</li>
<li>control vs.&nbsp;knee</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, for each of these pairwise comparison, we would run a separate independent-samples t-test. Recall from last week tutorial, we said for independent sample t-test, there is a single factor (explanatory) variable with two levels which split the subjects into two groups (control vs treatment). Okay, let's start with the first comparison (eyes vs.&nbsp;control).</p>
<p>To do this in SPSS, you can go to <strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; Independent-Samples T Test</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, place our dependent variable (Shift) in “<em>Test variable</em>” field and the <em>treatment</em> in the “<em>Grouping variable</em>” field.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/t-test_anova_groups.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From the result, we can see, our t-test is significant; there is indeed a difference between control and eyes, t(13)= 3.638, p&lt;0.05.</p>
<p>So, that’s how to use T-test to compare two groups. But since we have other groups defined above, you can repeat the same process and the procedure is the same as described here. You only need to specify which group you want to compare under the “<em>Define Groups.</em>”</p>

<section id="repeated-measures-anova" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repeated-measures-anova">Repeated Measures ANOVA</h4>
<p>Here, I will use the data from Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) to explain one-factor repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
<p>In this experiment, Behmer and Crump (2017) recruited 38 subjects to type words presented on a screen as quickly as they could. The independent variable was typing material and it had 3 levels: Normal (5 letter English words), Bigrams (5 letter non-words that have properties like real words), and Random (random 5 letter strings). The authors wanted to know whether reaction time (RT) was different according to the type of word being typed.</p>
<p>Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses). For this analysis we will use <code>Pure RTs</code> as our one DV.</p>
<p>Note that this is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions.</p>
<p>Behmer and Crump (2017) conducted a study with 38 participants to investigate the effect of different types of words on their typing performance. Here, the factor variable (“typing material”), had three levels: Random (random 5 letter strings), Normal (5 letter English words), and Bigrams (5 letter non-words similar to real words). The goal was to determine if reaction time (RT) varied depending on the type of word being typed.</p>
<p>The study measured three dependent variables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>RTs- reaction times- i.e.&nbsp;the time interval between seeing a stimulus and starting to type it.</li>
<li>inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs)- the time intervals between each key-press and</li>
<li>accuracy- measured by assessing correct or incorrect key-presses.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that this study followed a repeated measures design, as each participant repeatedly typed letter strings from the random, normal and bigrams.</p>
<p>To do this SPSS,</p>
<p>Load in the data (download from the Google dive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GGJIjoVYOSr7qcIGw2bXxskr7eJvC4oj/view?usp=sharing">link</a>)</p>
<p>Let’s do a quick EDA before we proceed- make a histogram plot to look at our data.</p>
<p>Remember to do this, you can</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>go to <strong>Graphs &gt;</strong> <strong>Histogram</strong></li>
<li>A graph window will pop up and ask you to specify the variable you would like graphed. Select the “<strong>PureRTs</strong>” from the list and drag it to the "Variable" field and click “<strong>OK</strong>”.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Hist_PureRTs.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The result shows a clear right skewed distribution (with longer tails being on the right side of the peak). In other words, we can see that most of the reaction times falls below 5000ms. These could have been be due to distraction or other factors.</p>
<p>Since this is a skewed distribution, the best thing to do is to remove those values (above 5000) so they do not influence or bias our results.</p>
<p>To do this in SPSS, you can go to the top menu, select “<strong>Data</strong>” &gt; “<strong>Select Cases</strong>”. The pop-up window will ask which cases to select. Here, we want to remove any cases &gt; 5000.</p>
<p>Now, check off “If condition is satisfied” and then click “<strong>If</strong>”. A new window will pop-up asking you to specify the condition. Select the PureRTs variable and move it to the right field. You can then, type less than 5000 ("&lt; 5000") to specify that we want to keep only values below 5000ms.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Continue</strong> and voila, your data engineered! You can plot the histogram again to confirm this</p>
<p>Recall, the data contain repeated measurements from many subjects. And our goal is to get a single reaction time/person/condition. To do this, we can take an individual's reaction time for a specific condition and take the average. In other words, we have to calculate the mean reaction time for each individual.</p>
<p>To do this in SPSS, click on <strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; Means</strong></p>
<p>In the pop-up window, select and drag the “PureRTS” into the "Dependent List" and the “Subject variable” should go into the "Independent List". Click Next and drag the “Stimulus” variable there.</p>
<p>Finally, click OK and the result containing each subject's average RT per condition will show</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/mean RT per person.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, we will Conduct One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA on the mean reaction time per subject</p>
</section>
<section id="section-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-1"></h4>
<p><strong>One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA</strong></p>
<p>To do that, lets work with this data ( the mean we just calculated). See the link <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MG4YI8RAdabTe8dQS4Ell2dZyfh3dj59/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Load in the data to SPSS. You may have already noticed that each person's data is contained within a row (38 in total): there are 3 measurements corresponding to all conditions (random, normal and bigrams).</p>
<p>So, to calculate a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA in SPSS, click on</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Analyze &gt; General Linear Model&gt; Repeated Measures</strong></li>
<li>The next pop-up window will ask for label for within-subjects variable. You can type “<strong>Stimulus</strong>” into the "Within-Subjects Factor Name". Number of levels = 3. Then click Add, and then Define.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, move all 3 conditions (Bigrams, Normal &amp; Random) into the "Within-Subjects Variables" field and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>You should get an output like below:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/within-subject effects.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From this result, we can see that there seems to be a significant effect of stimulus on reaction times, F(2, 74)= 420.33, p&lt;.05.</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>To examine where the difference among these 3 conditions are (and demonstrate the use of paired sample t-test), we will do a (planned comparison) PostHoc test. Recall (like we did for one-way ANOVA) that this is a pairwise comparison and only takes 2 groups at a time.</p>
<p>The 3 group comparisons here are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>random vs.&nbsp;normal</p></li>
<li><p>normal vs.&nbsp;bigram</p></li>
<li><p>bigram vs.&nbsp;random</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Run the analysis again like we did the other time for two-sample t-test but here, we will use a paired-samples t-test. This is because the same people are remeasured in each group for each comparison.</p>
<p>In SPSS, click on <strong>Analyze &gt; Compare Means &gt; Paired Samples T-test.</strong> Then move the first pairwise comparison (random vs.&nbsp;normal) to the right and click “<strong>OK</strong>”.</p>
<p>You should get the result like below:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/paired_sample_t.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From the result, we can see that the Random vs.&nbsp;Normal conditions are indeed significantly different, t(37)= 20.989, p&lt;0.05 (and all conventional levels of significance).</p>
<p>Following the same approach, you can do pairwise comparisons for the remaining groups.</p>
